    <p class="description">
     Conversely, this is graph is representative of exceptional trends as the range of the data is wider than that of the previous and it is not as "smooth".    
    </p>
    <p class="description">There are greater outliers (e.g. 1,3, &amp; 10 on the x axis) in this graph; so much so that the mean of the data changed.
    </p>
    <p class="description">This demonstrates Cairo's point that the mean is sensitive to extreme values, but the median isn't.
