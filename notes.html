<h1> Notes</h1>
<p>
    The graphs shown on my site were created by me in Excel as examples. The data was created for these examples.</p> 
<p>Additonally, basic CSS was added to make the site slightly more appealing.</p> <p>Float elements were used for the layout of the page.</p>
<p> I learned how to add mean and median lines to graphs for this assignment. I also made sure that the Y axes were the same so that the charts were comprable.</p>
